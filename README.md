# Jukebox Portal

Listen to songs, albums or playlists by placing a LEGO minifigure on the 
LEGO Dimensions pad and enjoy the audio and light show!

The "toys-to-life" LEGO Dimensions console game was discontinued in October 2017. 
Now you can bring it back to life as a Spotify controller by connecting the USB 
toy pad to a Raspberry Pi and running this Jukebox Portal app.
<p/>
Spotify control is not limited to LEGO minifigures. Disney Infinity 
characters, NFC tags, stickers or cards can be assigned to a Spotify song, 
album or playlist too.

While the light show plays for the duration of the track, on the Jukebox Portal 
web app, the album art of the current track is displayed.
